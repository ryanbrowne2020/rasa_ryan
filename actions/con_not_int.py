"To maintain or gain muscle mass, diet is also important. When cooking,  \
you can make a recipe centered on proteins such as meat, fish, and eggs.",
"In order to increase muscle mass, you want to get protein in your diet. \
For example, you can add a pack of natto or one boiled egg to your meal. \
If you want to easily incorporate protein, we recommend the salad chicken \
sold at supermarkets and convenience stores, and the boiled egg that can be easily made at home. \
These can also be eaten instead of snacks.",

quantities in seafood, eggs and mushrooms. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption \
in the body, strengthens bones, and promotes muscle synthesis."
